******** A VERY VERY VERY LONG AND WHINEY INTRO ********

This is probably the most pathetic attempt of building a website/web application you have ever seen.
It is not the best I can do but under the circumstances... I can no longer waste time on it.
I had a working website made from these elements before, it had a very basic backend of sending messages to the database. No subpages, no reading, nothing. I had help creating it 4 years ago. 
I was going to use it and submit it, however I forgot that I only salvaged stuff on my E: and F: partitions, not C: where XAMPP was installed. So I had to go and do it from scratch (had some html/css done before)
I was pressured for time, so most probably this will not even be enough for a pass.
I am OK with it as I am going to try to have this subject at least partly recognised from my previous school.
Please don't laugh. Please don't be disappointed in me.
I am learning, my conditions are not ideal. And I feel ashamed that I still haven't figured it out.
I haven't been able to fix the entry form to actually send something to the database.
I fixed adminLogin.php to check username admin1 and password1 and upon click redirect to admin.php
admin.php was working - displaying lines in a cute table with a "delete" button at the end of each entry.
I don't know what I did but admin.php is not working any more. Yes, I am THAT thick. But I am being honest.

Check where your XAMPP or MAMP folder is. In it, find folder htdocs. Take this folder and transfer it into htdocs (folder with its contents)
I will try to provide SQL code, too. You must run it in phpadmin's database administrator (find tab SQL). There are only 2 tables; admins and messages. Admins has only 1 entry: username: "admin1", password: "password1"
phpadmin credentials: database: "my_project", user: "root", password: "root".
